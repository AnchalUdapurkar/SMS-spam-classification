The SMS Spam Classification project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). This involves cleaning and preprocessing the text data, converting it into a structured numerical format using techniques like tokenization and vectorization, and applying various machine learning algorithms to predict spam messages. The project uses methods such as Naive Bayes and logistic regression, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing between legitimate messages and spam. This model can be applied in real-world scenarios like filtering spam in telecom services, banking alerts, and mobile messaging platforms, ensuring secure and clutter-free communication.
